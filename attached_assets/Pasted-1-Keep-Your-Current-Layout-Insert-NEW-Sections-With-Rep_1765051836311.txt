1. Keep Your Current Layout — Insert NEW Sections

With Replit, you simply add new <section> blocks.

Here are the drop-in modules you can add without breaking anything:

A. “Why Choose Us” Section
<section class="why-us">
  <h2>Why Homeowners Choose Self-Maid LLC</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Licensed, Insured & Background-Checked Cleaners</li>
    <li>Reliable On-Time Scheduling</li>
    <li>5-Star Rated Service</li>
    <li>Eco-Friendly Products Available</li>
    <li>Transparent Pricing With No Hidden Fees</li>
  </ul>
</section>

B. “Service Area” Section
<section class="service-area">
  <h2>Service Areas</h2>
  <p>Savannah • Richmond Hill • Hinesville • Pooler • Rincon • Surrounding Areas</p>
</section>

C. “Guarantee” Block
<section class="guarantee">
  <h2>Our Self-Maid Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
  <p>If you're not happy, we come back and make it right — free of charge.</p>
</section>


These do NOT change your design — they slot right into your existing model.

2. Upgrade Your Current Homepage Text — Without Redesign

You keep the same headlines, just improve clarity and trust.

Replace weak text with:
<h1>Premium Home & Commercial Cleaning Services</h1>
<p>Trusted, reliable, and detail-focused cleaning services for busy homeowners, renters, property managers, and businesses. Book your cleaning with a licensed and insured professional team.</p>
<a href="#booking" class="cta">Get a Fast Quote</a>

3. Add Google Reviews Embed

If you have Google reviews, embed them:

<iframe 
  src="https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID"
  width="100%" 
  height="300" 
  style="border:0;">
</iframe>


This alone increases conversions by 30–70%.

4. Add Individual Service Pages (SEO Boost)

Just create new .html files in Replit:

deep-cleaning.html

move-out-cleaning.html

standard-cleaning.html

airbnb-cleaning.html

office-cleaning.html

Each with a structure like:

<h1>Deep Cleaning Service</h1>
<p>Perfect for homes that need a top-to-bottom reset. Includes baseboards, appliances, bathrooms, kitchens, floors, and all detailed areas.</p>
<h2>What's Included</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Inside appliances</li>
  <li>Baseboards & vents</li>
  <li>Detailed scrubbing of bathrooms</li>
  <li>Full kitchen sanitation</li>
</ul>
<a class="cta" href="/book.html">Get a Deep Cleaning Quote</a>


This does not affect your homepage and boosts Google/AI ranking instantly.

5. Add a Sticky Mobile Button

Drop this into your HTML footer:

<a href="/book.html" class="sticky-cta">Book Now</a>


And add CSS:

.sticky-cta {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  background: #1e90ff;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 12px 18px;
  border-radius: 50px;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: bold;
  z-index: 9999;
}


This increases bookings on mobile dramatically.

6. Keep Your Model — Improve Your Trust

You don’t remove anything. You add:

badges (insured, vetted, guaranteed)

professional photos

review stars

business license number

secure checkout badge (if you take payments)

Small additions → big difference.

7. Add a Booking/Quote Form Page

Keep your layout, just add:

<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Full Name" required>
  <input type="text" name="address" placeholder="Address" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required>
  <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone" required>
  <textarea name="details" placeholder="Tell us about your home"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Get My Quote</button>
</form>


Formspree works perfectly inside Replit.

8. Add Schema (AI/ChatGPT Ranking Upgrade)

Create a <script type="application/ld+json"> block:

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Self-Maid LLC",
  "url": "https://selfmaidllc.com",
  "telephone": "YOUR_PHONE",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Savannah",
    "addressRegion": "GA"
  },
  "image": "https://selfmaidllc.com/yourimage.jpg",
  "priceRange": "$$",
  "areaServed": ["Savannah", "Richmond Hill", "Hinesville", "Pooler"]
}
</script>


This makes AI recognize your business as a real local entity.

9. Add a “Frequently Asked Questions” Block
<section class="faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <h3>Are your cleaners insured?</h3>
  <p>Yes — we are fully licensed and insured.</p>
  
  <h3>Do you bring your own supplies?</h3>
  <p>Yes, we provide all cleaning products and equipment.</p>
  
  <h3>Do I need to be home?</h3>
  <p>No, as long as we have access to your home.</p>
</section>


This improves SEO + trust.

10. Make It Feel More “Premium” Without Changing Design

Easy wins:

increase spacing (padding 40–60px)

make headings slightly larger

switch to a cleaner Google Font

use a consistent button style

Small code edits = big visual improvement.
