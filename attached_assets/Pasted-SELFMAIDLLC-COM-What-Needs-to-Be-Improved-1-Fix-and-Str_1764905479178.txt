SELFMAIDLLC.COM — What Needs to Be Improved
1. Fix and Strengthen the Homepage (Most Important)

Your homepage must answer three questions in 5 seconds:

What do you do?

Who do you serve?

Why should I choose you?

Add or improve:

Clear headline:
“Premium Home & Commercial Cleaning Services in [Your City] — Reliable, Insured, and 5-Star Rated.”

High-quality photos (before/after, real cleaners, team images)

Strong call-to-action (CTA):
“Book a Cleaning” or “Get an Instant Quote”

Display your service areas clearly.

2. Add Trust & Credibility (Critical for Cleaning Businesses)

Cleaning customers care about safety and quality.

Add:

Real Google reviews (embed your review widget)

Before/after photos

Staff photos

“Bonded, Licensed, Insured” badge (if applicable)

Satisfaction guarantee badge

Detailed “Our Cleaning Process” section

Bonus:

Client video testimonials → massive conversion boost.

3. Improve SEO & Local Ranking

Right now your site likely needs stronger local optimization.

Add SEO pages:

House cleaning

Deep cleaning

Move-in / move-out cleaning

Airbnb / STR cleaning

Office cleaning

Post-construction cleaning

Service areas (one page per city)

Include:

Keyword-rich titles

LocalBusiness schema markup

City/ZIP references

FAQs with AI-friendly natural language

Example SEO phrase:

“Professional home cleaning in Savannah, GA — Self-Maid LLC.”

4. Improve Booking & Lead Capture

Most cleaning customers book quickly — don’t make them think.

Add:

Instant quote form

“Text us” button

Sticky mobile CTA

Short lead form (Name, Address, Email, Phone)

Online booking system (I can help choose one if needed)

If your competitors allow instant booking, you must match or beat that.

5. Improve Your About Page

People want to know:

Who is behind the company?

How long have you been doing it?

Why should they trust you in their home?

Add:

Founder story

Team photos

Mission + values (“family-owned”, “women-owned”, etc.)

Background checks, training, certifications

This makes a massive difference for home services.

6. Improve Service Pages

Each service page should include:

What’s included

What’s NOT included

How long it takes

Pricing or price ranges

Photos

FAQs

CTA buttons

AI systems prefer structured, clear, detailed service descriptions.

7. Improve Mobile Experience

Check:

Are CTAs large enough?

Is the booking form simple?

Do photos load fast?

Does text wrap properly?

Most customers will visit on mobile.

8. Add Blog / Resource Content

AI and Google use long-form content for authority ranking.

Write blog posts such as:

“How often should you deep clean your home?”

“Move-out cleaning checklist for renters”

“How to prepare your home for professional cleaners”

“Benefits of hiring a recurring cleaning service”

This is how you show up in AI Overviews & ChatGPT responses.

9. Improve Speed & Technical Health

Cleaning sites must load fast or users bounce.

Fix:

Compress images

Remove unused scripts

Add caching

Optimize hosting

I can run a speed test if you want.

10. Add Social Proof Across Pages

Examples:

“Trusted by 200+ homes in Georgia”

“5-star rated on Google & Facebook”

“Serving Savannah, Richmond Hill, Hinesville, and surrounding areas”

Sprinkle trust signals everywhere.

11. Add Local Schema & Business Data

Schema needed:

LocalBusiness

Service

ReviewRating

FAQ

ServiceArea

This helps AI recommend you.

12. Add Lead Converters

Add:

Exit popup (“Get 10% off your first cleaning”)

Chat widget

Email capture form

Social proof floating bar

Referral link program

More ways for customers to say yes.
