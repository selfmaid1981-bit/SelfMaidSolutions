You’ve got a strong base already—clear services, social proof, and local focus. What’s missing is exactly what you said: the why behind your process—your training guide and no‑nonsense plan—and the emotional promise: stress relief, peace of mind, comfort.

Here’s a focused breakdown and then ready‑to-paste code.

Quick analysis of your current homepage

• Hero focus right now:
The main hero is about “Premium Home & Commercial Cleaning Services”, locations, and credibility badges (insured, 5‑star, 16 years). It’s strong, but very service-provider generic.
• Emotional promise:
The page emphasizes reliability and experience, but doesn’t clearly say:
“We clean to alleviate stress and create peace of mind and comfort.”
That’s your differentiator and it’s not front and center yet.
• Process & training:
You mention being fully insured, bonded, background-checked, but there’s no explicit section about:• An extensive training guide, or
• A no-nonsense plan/checklist for each visit
This is a huge trust-builder and should be its own highlight.

• What I’d change at the top:1. Rewrite the hero headline + subheadline to lead with stress relief and peace of mind.
2. Add a “How We Clean Every Time” or “Our No‑Nonsense Cleaning Plan” section near the top.
3. Explicitly call out your training guide and visit checklist as part of your promise.
