## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Too much text on images (Facebook penalizes this)
❌ Targeting too broad (all of Alabama = waste of money)
❌ Not using lead forms (making people call/visit website loses 70%)
❌ Giving up after 1 week (needs time to optimize)
❌ Not responding fast to leads (respond within 1 hour!)

---

## WINNING AD FORMULA

1. **Attention-grabbing image** (before/after works best)
2. **Clear benefit** (save time, get deposit back, etc.)
3. **Trust signals** (16 years, insured, 500+ customers)
4. **Clear offer** ($20 off or free quote)
5. **Easy action** (call or fill form)

---

## RESPONSE PROTOCOL

When you get a lead:

**Within 1 hour**:
1. Call them
2. If no answer, text: "Hi [Name]! Got your request for a cleaning quote. When's a good time to chat? - Self-Maid Cleaning"
3. Send email with quote form link

**Within 24 hours**: Follow up again if no response

**Conversion rate drops 80% if you wait more than 24 hours!**

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Choose 2-3 ad copies from above
2. ✅ Take before/after photos at your next clean
3. ✅ Set up Facebook Business Page (if needed)
4. ✅ Create Ads Manager account
5. ✅ Start with $5/day for 2 weeks
6. ✅ Track results in spreadsheet
7. ✅ Optimize and scale!

**Timeline**: Can launch in 1 week!
