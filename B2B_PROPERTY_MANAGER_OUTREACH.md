### Phone Script Template

**Opening:**
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with Self-Maid Cleaning Solutions here in Montgomery. 

I sent you a LinkedIn message / email last week about helping with turnover cleaning for your properties. Did you have a chance to see that?"

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]
```

**If YES (they saw it):**
```
"Great! I wanted to follow up personally because we're currently taking on 2-3 new property management partners and I thought [Company Name] would be a great fit.

Do you have 5 minutes now, or would later this week work better?"
```

**If NO (they didn't see it):**
```
"No worries—I know you're busy! Here's why I'm calling:

We provide same-day turnover cleaning for property managers in Montgomery and Prattville. Our average turnover is 4-6 hours instead of 3-5 days.

That means less vacancy time and more rent money for your properties.

I'd love to offer you a FREE trial turnover on your next vacancy so you can see the quality yourself. Does that interest you?"
```

**Handling Objections:**

**"We have someone already."**
```
"That's great! Can I ask—how long does it typically take them to turn a unit around? 

[LISTEN]

The reason I ask is most of our property management partners came to us because they needed faster turnarounds. We offer same-day service, which means you can list properties 2-3 days sooner.

Would you be open to trying us on one unit, just to have a backup option for when you need something fast?"
```

**"Send me some information."**
```
"Absolutely! I'll email you right after this call.

While I have you though—what's your biggest frustration with property turnovers right now? That way I can make sure the info I send is relevant to you.

[LISTEN - This often opens the conversation]
```

**"How much do you charge?"**
```
"Great question! It depends on the size and condition, but for a typical 3-bedroom property, we're around $150-180 for a move-out clean.

For property managers doing volume with us, we offer 15% off recurring service.

How many properties are you typically turning per month?"

[GET NUMBER - This qualifies them]
```

**Closing:**
```
"Here's what I'd like to do, [First Name]:

Let me clean one of your next turnovers for FREE. No obligation, no strings attached. Just so you can see our quality and speed.

If you love it, we can discuss ongoing service. If not, no hard feelings and you got a free clean out of it.

Sound fair?"

[CLOSE FOR THE APPOINTMENT]

"Perfect! What's the address of the next property you need turned? I'll have my team coordinator reach out to schedule the walkthrough."
```
